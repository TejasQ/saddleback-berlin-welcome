# Saddleback Berlin Welcome

This app, created to serve newcomers and visitors to Saddleback Berlin, exists to fulfill 3 purposes:

* Help people find and join small groups,
* Help people find and join ministries,
* Help people find out about upcoming events at our church – Class 101/201/301/401, picnics, etc.

It is built with the power of React. It uses Webpack for the bundling, and SCSS for the styling.

## Getting Started

The following 4 commands in order should help you get started.


* Clone the repo with: `git clone [repo]`
* Change directory to the repo's directory: `cd [repo]`
* Install this project's dependencies: `yarn install`
* Begin serving the app so you can see stuff in a browser: `npm run serve`

Once it's up and running, everything lives in `./src`, so happy coding!

## TODOs

These are barebones and basic, and will only serve as a guide for now. We will use issue tracking shortly.

* Create SCSS that adheres to the styleguide.
* ✅ Create a `<Tile />` component to show an interactive tile that handles click logic.
* ✅ Implement React Router (v4 Beta, because we cool like dat).
* Create presentational components.
* Create container components.
* ✅ Find and implement a good Google Maps wrapper for the `<SmallGroupsComponent />`.
* Create a `<FormComponent />`.
* Create a `<ModalBoxComponent />`.
